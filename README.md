#  sceptik

Very simple yet powerful tool for `role` üë©‚Äçüíª and `attribute` üëÄ based permission checking.

### Example

```js
const emily = getPerms({roles: ['guest']}, 'article')

if (emily.canCreate) {
  // ...
}
```

Another example taste üç¨

```js
const user = { roles: ['guest'] }
const { canCreate } = getPerms(user, 'article')

if (canCreate) {
  // ...
}
```

### Available permissions

Every permission is identified as in `unix`. The list is extended by some more.

 - `c`: create
 - `w`: write/edit
 - `r`: read
 - `d`: delete
 - `l`: list
 - `x`: execute

`getPerms` though, return not only the list of the permissions but a list of syntactical `bools` to improve readability when using the api:

- `canCreate`
- `canEdit`
- `canRead`
- `canDelete`
- `canList`
- `canOnlyRead`
- `canExecute` 
- `cannotCreate`
- `cannotEdit`
- `cannotRead`
- `cannotDelete`
- `cannotList`
- `cannotExecute`

**NOTE:** Role `admin` has always all `cwrdlx`

## Usage

Must provide an array of rules as the permission matrix to initialize the tool.

### Initialization.

```js
import initPerms from 'sceptik'

const rules = [
  { role: 'guest', target: 'article',         perms: 'r'      },
  { role: 'pro',   target: 'article',         perms: 'cwrl'   }
] 

const { getPermsAsActions } = initPerms({
  rules
})
```

For fine graining your entities or model access just add paths as properties. 

Example:

```js
const rules = [
  { role: 'guest',   target: 'article.body',         perms: ''   }
]

// User with a 'guest' role can't even read the body of an article.
```


### Check the permissions.

```js
const emily = getPerms({roles: ['guest']}, 'article')

console.log(
  emily.perms,        // ['l']
  emily.canEdit,      // false
  emily.canCreate,    // false
  emily.canEdit,      // false
  emily.canRead,      // true
  emily.canDelete,    // false
  emily.canList,      // false
  emily.canOnlyRead,  // true
  emily.canExecute,   // false
  emily.cannotCreate, // true 
  emily.cannotEdit,   // true
  emily.cannotRead,   // false
  emily.cannotDelete, // true
  emily.cannotList,   // true
  emily.cannotExecute // true
)
```

## ROADMAP

- Add React Hook `usePerms`
- Add `entity` checking (ownsership)
- Make it extensible (add and interpret checker functions in rule matrix)
- Make permission types extensible (add more than just `cwrdlx`
- Add async initialization (permission matrix may come from the backend)
- Add async dynamic checking of rules
