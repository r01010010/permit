#  sceptik

Very simple yet powerful tool for `role` üë©‚Äçüíª and `attribute` üëÄ based permission checking. Includes support for your own dynamic checkers.

### Example

```js
import initSceptik from 'sceptik'

// Define yor own checkers
const isAuthor = (user, { entity }) => {
  return user.id === entity.author.id
}

// Create your rule matrix
// Sceptik uses initials as in unix `cwrdlx`
export const rules = [
  { role: 'guest',      target: 'article',    permissions: [['--r---'], ['cwrdlx', isAuthor]]  },
  { role: 'pro',        target: 'article',    permissions: [['c-r-l-']]                        },
]

//
const { getPerms } = initSceptik({
  rules
})

// EXAMPLE 1: üç™

const emily = getPerms({ roles: ['guest'] }, 'article')

console.log(
  emily.perms,        // ['r']
  emily.canEdit,      // false
  emily.canCreate,    // false
  emily.canRead,      // true
  emily.canDelete,    // false
  emily.canList,      // false
  emily.canOnlyRead,  // true
  emily.canExecute,   // false
  emily.cannotCreate, // true 
  emily.cannotEdit,   // true
  emily.cannotRead,   // false
  emily.cannotDelete, // true
  emily.cannotList,   // true
  emily.cannotExecute // true
)


// EXAMPLE 2: üç¨

const user = { roles: ['guest'] }
const { canCreate } = getPerms(user, 'article')

console.log(canCreate) // false


// EXAMPLE 3 (Dynamic check on entity): üç´

const user = { id: 1, roles: ['guest'] }
const article = { author: user }

const { perms } = getPerms(user, 'article', { entity: article })

console.log(perms) // ['c', 'w', 'r', 'd', 'l', 'x']


```

### Available permissions

Every permission is identified as in `unix`. The list is extended by some more.

 - `c`: create
 - `w`: write/edit
 - `r`: read
 - `d`: delete
 - `l`: list
 - `x`: execute

`getPerms` though, return not only the list of the permissions but a list of syntactical `bools` to improve readability when using the api:

- `canCreate`
- `canEdit`
- `canRead`
- `canDelete`
- `canList`
- `canOnlyRead`
- `canExecute` 
- `cannotCreate`
- `cannotEdit`
- `cannotRead`
- `cannotDelete`
- `cannotList`
- `cannotExecute`

**NOTE:** Role `admin` has always all `cwrdlx`


## Roadmap

- [x] Add `entity` checking (ownsership)
- [x] Make it extensible (add and interpret checker functions in rule matrix)
- [ ] Add React Hook `usePerms`
- [ ] Make permission types extensible (add more than just `cwrdlx`
- [ ] Add async initialization (permission matrix may come from the backend)
- [ ] Add async dynamic checking of rules
